                That's right, this is the real Tasmanian devil, despite its size
                It is considered the largest carnivorous marsupial in the world.
                It has one of the most powerful bites and finally goes hunting at night.
                you can meet this animal on the island of Tasmania
                although it was recently reintroduced in Australia

                    The Great Barrier Reef. The largest reef in the world perfectly visible
                    from the moon, it houses thousands of species of coral and of course 
                    Where there are corals there is also marine life from the colorful "clown fish" to 
                    the imposing sharks
