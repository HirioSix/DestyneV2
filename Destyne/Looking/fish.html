                The exocetidae or flying fish (Exocoetidae) are a family of marine fish that includes about 70 species.
                grouped into 7 genres. They are found in all oceans, especially in warm tropical and subtropical waters.
                Its most surprising feature is the size of its pectoral fins, unusually large, which allow it to fly and glide. 
                Distances of more than 50 meters. The longest recorded duration was 45 seconds. Taking into account that adult exocetids measure only about 30 cm
                This ability goes far beyond simple jumps out of the water. Flying fish reach speeds in the air of 50 to 60 km/h.
                These distances and speeds are possible thanks to the rapid beating of its fins (about 50 times per second).
                The final advantage of this mechanism is a greater possibility of escape from predators.

                The flying fish is found in tropical and subtropical areas of all oceans, in the western Mediterranean Sea and in some areas of the Caribbean Sea.
