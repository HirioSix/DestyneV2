                The African elephant is the largest animal on the earth's surface. They can reach a height
                up to 4 meters high and its weight ranges between 2,200 and 6,350 kilograms. Although there are exceptions to this too:
                The largest elephant ever recorded reached a weight of more than 10,000 kilograms and a height of almost 4 meters!
                They have admirable longevity. The elephant has a life expectancy of up to 70 years. The world's oldest elephant lived to be 86 years old in captivity.
                At 12, females reach reproductive age and can begin to have children,
                something they do approximately every 4 years. On the other hand, at that age, males become independent and leave the herd.
